## Code Green! Virtual Workshop Sponsored by Thoughtworks


Code Green! brings builders together to solve sustainability-related technical challenges. In this workshop, we’ll explore the Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI) and learn how to access, manipulate and interpret a key data set. The scenario: Major League DeepRacer has swept the globe becoming a hugely popular event. You’re in charge of event logistics, and will use weather forecasting data to choose the stadium that will require the least heating and cooling to operate. You’ll access ASDI data from Amazon S3, use Athena to query it, and use API Gateway, Lambda, and S3 to view results. Join us for this 200-level workshop and get live advice from AWS Solutions architects as you walk through the guided build. Just bring a computer and AWS account, and look for the slot that fits your time zone.
