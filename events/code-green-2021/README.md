# Code Green! The sustainability data hackathon and workshop, sponsored by Thoughtworks (Event HJS304 at re:Invent 2021)


Are you a builder that loves our Earth? If so, come code ‘green’ with us and build solutions that empower a sustainable future. Choose your learning path in this **three part event**:
- Hack on your ideas for carbon emissions reduction, preserving biodiversity, and more (8 AM – 6:30 PM)
- Drop-in anytime to walk through a guided workshop and get hands-on with climate data (8 AM – 6:30 PM)
- Socialize with industry leaders like Adrian Cockcroft and others. (6:30 PM – 8 PM)

You can choose to participate in all three of our events or choose one or two. Register for HJS304 in the re:Invent attendee portal or walk-in on Monday at the Wynn, Lafite 5, to attend any of the above.

## Hackathon
The Code Green Hackathon is an all-day coding event for builders to solve a sustainability-related technical challenge. Entries will leverage sustainability data available in the *Amazon Sustainability Data Initiative (ASDI)* or *AWS Data Exchange (ADX)*. Prizes include reMarkable 2 paper tablets, $50k AWS credits, plus all registrants have the carbon emmisions of their air travel to re:Invent offset.

More details are [here](hackathon.md).

### Workshop 
An in-person sustainability workshop is offered for attendees who would prefer a more guided (but still hands-on) experience. The workshop is offered in the same room as the hackathon and takes about 2 hours. Builders will leverage AWS and ASDI to build a solution that can reduce heating and cooling costs for events.  You can access the workshop content [here](https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/v2/workshops/e2226f3d-4c4c-4a4a-bf8b-4f05209f02fd/en-US). 
 
Register as usual and drop-in anytime to participate. All registrants have the carbon emmisions of their air travel to re:Invent offset.
