## Code Green! - Workshop, Sponsored by Thoughtworks

In addition to the in-person hackathon, this event also contains an in-person workshop component to support attendees who would prefer a more guided (but still hands-on) working experience. The workshop will be offered in the same room as the hackathon. Builders will leverage AWS and ASDI to build a solution that can reduce heating and cooling costs for events. AWS experts will be available to assist you with the workshop.
